<p>Ok, let's face it, everybody hates high credit card rates, and they drain hard earned money out of your wallet. As a valued consumer, it is apparent that you learn how to negotiate to get the absolute best rate that you possibly can. The good news however is that it doesn't have to be a difficult or time-consuming process. In fact, it can be very easy indeed if you know what you're doing. In this article we will discuss the ins and outs of credit card negotiating to ensure that you get the best possible rate with the least amount of effort.</p><p></p><p><li>First and foremost, you should figure out if you even want to continue using your current credit card company ( <a href="http://www.the-credit-card-centre.co.uk/best-credit-cards.html" target="_new">http://www.the-credit-card-centre.co.uk/best-credit-cards.html</a> ). Are you pleased with the overall service that you are receiving? Do you like their benefits? If the answer is yes then you can proceed. If not, you should stop reading this article and start looking for a better company.</p><p><li>Second, you should evaluate your paying history and make sure that it is positive before you call to negotiate. If it is positive then you have power and if it isn't then you'll be negotiating from a position of weakness and that might not be good. Instead, you should wait until it is more positive before you call them to negotiate rates.</p><p><li>Third, if you have a good history then remember this when you call. In essence, you'll have extremely high negotiating power. The company needs your business in order to be successful and with clients they lose big time. Therefore, you should always display this &quot;take them or leave them attitude&quot; while conducting your negotiations.</p><p><li>Draft up a script and memorize it. It can be as simple as &quot;Hello, my name is Bill and I have been a cardholder for X years and I consistently pay my bills on a time. Well recently I have been receiving all types of credit card offers from XYZ bank indicating that I qualify for an extremely low interest rate of X and am considering leaving you and going there if you can't offer me a lower rate. Is this something that you can help me with?</p><p><li>Practice, practice and practice some more with your script until you are completely and totally used to it. Once you are, contact the company. Read your script and see what happens.</p><p><li>If you get a hard nose customer service representative then don't threaten her. Be agreeable and ask to speak to his/her supervisor. If that is not possible, be nice to her and try again she may have some leeway. If you like your present company, you can even try negotiating interest rates, annual and even those yucky late fees.</p><p><li>However, if you're fed up, have an alternative company in the wings, and your current company won't budge with their rates then be willing to take your business elsewhere. After all, you hold the power so don't be afraid to use it! They key however is to not bluff but to follow through with your threat. Close the account, ask for them to send you notification in the mail, cancel the credit card and use another card.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, you can be successful with the negotiating process if you follow the above mentioned tips.  If your current company is unwilling to cooperate then you should simply take your business elsewhere. You're better off with another credit card company that values your savvy negotiating skills!</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Claire Bowes is a successful freelance writer and owner of The Credit Card Centre ( <a href="http://www.the-credit-card-centre.co.uk" target="_new">http://www.the-credit-card-centre.co.uk</a> ) where you will find further advice and tips on the best credit card deals ( <a href="http://www.the-credit-card-centre.co.uk/best-credit-cards.html" target="_new">http://www.the-credit-card-centre.co.uk/best-credit-cards.html</a> )and 0% credit cards ( <a href="http://www.the-credit-card-centre.co.uk/0%-credit-cards.html" target="_new">http://www.the-credit-card-centre.co.uk/0%-credit-cards.html</a> ).</p><p>
<p>Professionals in tend to under-estimate the power of the web to bring them business, and to bring them precisely the kinds of clients they want! And, a few, invest in a great web site, but then don't market it effectively! There are some wonderful sites that are virtually "hidden" out there on the web. Web marketing has one thing in common with other advertising:  no matter how good the ad, it won't build your business unless lots of people see it.</p><p>I tell my clients to view web marketing as having two separate components:  first is the creation of a site, and second is marketing it. Building a site requires creativity, design skills, and an understanding of color, images, and popular trends. Marketing a site, on the other hand, is a much more routine, repetitious, even boring task that must be done consistently over time. The following are my Top 10 suggestions for marketing your web site:</p><p>1. Hidden Title.   This is the first of three critical items that are coded in the "Head" of every web page. It is the first thing a search engine sees at the top of your page. While this title is visible on browsers, most people ignore it. I've seen great sites that have no title at all! Use 3-8 words that describe what you do and flag your site for the search engines.</p><p>2. Meta Tag: Keywords.   The second item in the "Head" of your page should be a hidden Meta tag with 15-25 words to help people find you. These are words people are likely to enter in a search request to find you. An Accountant might have a string that started with: "Accounting, bookkeeping, records, taxes,?."</p><p>3. Meta Tag: Description.  The third item in the "Head" is a hidden sentence that describes both your page and your site. Make it vibrant, use as many of your Keywords as possible, and make it accurate. This is a one-sentence description of who you are, what you do, and why people should visit your page. You've got 15-20 words. Use them!</p><p>4. Visible Title.   This is the first thing people will see, and it's what most people think of as the "title" of their page. Again, you want it to invite people, be accurate, and brief. While a beautiful logo or banner may look nice at the top of your page, remember that 3-5 powerful words will down-load faster. The words in your title will also connect with search engines in a way that your logo can't.</p><p>5. First words on page.   The first few seconds as a page down-loads are critical, and a short statement of what you do will down-load faster than most images. First impressions count! And again, search engines can catalog a brief but exciting description of your business, but they won't catalog your pretty picture!</p><p>6. Have multiple pages, each with their own marketing system. A simple way to increase the "hits" on your site is to increase the number of entrance paths. Rather than have one long page, divide it into three pages, each with their own title, meta tags, and descriptions! If your pages are all linked within one site, you vastly increase the opportunities for people to find you.</p><p>7. Submit to search tools repeatedly.   Search engines constantly up-date and expand their databases. To stay in the game, I suggest you re-submit your site at least once a month and re-submit after every change. Using the web to draw business is an on-going project, not a once and forget it task! There are services that will do this for you (for less than $100), or you can do it yourself. But schedule several hours every month, and do it!</p><p>8. Include your web URL on your other advertising.   This seems obvious, but lots of people forget. Have your site on your business card, brochures, all of your advertising! If people are interested, want more information, or are just curious, make it easy for them to check you out. Display your URL on everything!</p><p>9. Exchange links.  One of the best ways to increase traffic, and to target specific audiences, is to trade links with other sites that attract a similar audience. I recommend that you have a page dedicated to "Favorite Links" that have agreed to also put a link to your site on their page. "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" is a great way to build your web marketing impact.</p><p>10. Have something of value that changes often. Give your visitors something they can learn, do, or enjoy each time they visit. Let them sign up for your newsletter, post a "Joke of the Day" or a daily quote. It doesn't have to relate directly to your business. People love parenting tips, humor, inspiration or practical tips for better living (Think Martha Stewart!). Give them a reason to come back!</p><p>Have a wonderful week, and remember to have some fun!</p><p>Â© Copyright 2003 by Philip E. Humbert. All Rights Reserved.
